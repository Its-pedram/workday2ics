# Workday2ics

A simple website to convert Workday saved schedules to an ics file so you can import it into your calendar.

## About

Our university decided to migrate to Workday from their old SIS system. The new system lacks some of the features of the previous system, one of which is the ability to export your schedule to a calendar file, which led to the creation of this project.
